Macros- IMem
It is like a function
This macro accepts a byte address as input, and produces the 32-bit read data as output.
`READONLY_MEM($addr, $$read_data[31:0])
Verilog macro instantiation is preceded by a back-tick (not to be confused with a single quote).
In expressions like this that do not syntactically differentiate assigned signals from consumed signals, it is necessary to identify assigned signals using a "$$" prefix.
